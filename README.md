## Shopping List

I build a shopping list Web App working with AngularJS, MySQL and Bootstrap with little help from a tutorial. 
I will start from the index page and we will go with the photos to understand the structure of the App.

Let's add some items to our list.

![Alt text](pics/addingitems1.jpg "addingItems1")

You can mark some items as Done from your list and you can delete them.

![Alt text](pics/markAsDone.jpg "markasDone")

![Alt text](pics/deleteDoneItems.jpg "delete")

You can also filter the items of your list to find them faster.

And that's it.It's simple but good for practice.
